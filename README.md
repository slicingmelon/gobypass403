# GoByPASS403

A powerful WAF (HTTP 403/401) and URL parser bypass tool developed in Go, designed to preserve exact URL paths and structures during testing. Unlike Go's standard libraries, the tool enables true raw HTTP requests without any encoding or normalization, ensuring complete control over the request structure. This functionality is powered by a full-stack HTTP client, independent of Go's internals, and a custom URL parser.

## Features

- **Raw URL Preservation**: Unlike other Go tools that use the standard `net/url` package which automatically normalizes and encodes URLs, Go-Bypass-403 preserves the exact URL structure similar to curl's `--path-as-is` flag. This is crucial for WAF bypass attempts where path traversal and specific URL structures need to be maintained.

- **Custom URL Parser**: Implements a specialized URL parser that prevents Go's default security measures from interfering with bypass attempts. This allows for testing of edge cases and security boundaries that would otherwise be normalized away.

- **Multiple Bypass Techniques**: 
  - Path manipulation (mid-path, end-path)
  - Case substitution
  - Headers manipulation (IP, scheme, URL, port)
  - Character encoding variations
  - And more...

- **CDN Bypass Support**: Special features for testing CDN-based bypasses using host substitution

# Bypass Modules

Some description..

## char_encode

The `char_encode` module implements targeted character encoding techniques to bypass WAF pattern matching. It systematically generates payloads by applying URL encoding to specific characters in the path.

The module works on four strategic positions:

- Last character of the path
- First character after any leading slash
- Each character in the last path segment
- Each character throughout the entire path

For each position, it generates:
- Single encoding (`%xx`)
- Double encoding (`%25xx`)
- Triple encoding (`%2525xx`)

For example, with a URL like `https://example.com/admin`:

```
/admin → /admi%6e          # Last character encoded
/admin → /%61dmin          # First character encoded  
/admin → /adm%69n          # Character in path encoded
```

Special characters like `?` and `#` are handled with proper percent-encoding to preserve query parameters.

## mid_paths

The `mid_paths` module injects path traversal sequences and special character combinations using a predefined list of payloads (`internal_midpaths.lst`).

For a URL like `/a/b`, the module creates these variants:

1. Before path:
   - `PAYLOAD/a/b`
   - `/PAYLOAD/a/b`

2. At each segment:
   - `/PAYLOADa/b` (fused with first segment start)
   - `/aPAYLOAD/b` (fused with first segment end)
   - `/a/PAYLOADb` (fused with second segment start)
   - `/a/bPAYLOAD` (fused with second segment end)

3. After each slash:
   - `/a/PAYLOAD/b` (inserted after a slash)

Each variant is generated with appropriate path normalization handling. The module carefully manages special characters in path segments, generating additional variants with percent-encoded `?` and `#` characters when necessary.

## end_paths 

The `end_paths` module appends a variety of suffixes from a predefined list (`internal_endpaths.lst`) to the end of the URL path. This technique targets path normalization vulnerabilities and extension handling issues in WAFs.

For a URL like `https://example.com/admin`, the module generates:

1. Standard suffix variants:
   - `/admin/SUFFIX`
   - `/admin/SUFFIX/`

2. Direct append variants (when the base path isn't root `/` and suffix doesn't start with a letter):
   - `/adminSUFFIX`
   - `/adminSUFFIX/`

Common suffixes include:
- Path traversal sequences: `..;/`, `../`, `./`
- Special characters: `;`, `:`, `%20`
- Common extensions: `.json`, `.php~`, `.bak`

The module preserves the original query string and handles special characters with proper percent-encoding to maintain request integrity.

## path_prefix

The `path_prefix` module manipulates path segments using specific byte patterns to bypass security checks. It systematically prefixes URL segments with ASCII control characters, special characters, and the literal 'x' character.

For each relevant byte value, the module creates three distinct variations:

1. Dummy Segment Prefix (Single Byte):
   - Adds a new first segment containing the byte value
   - Example: `/admin` → `/[b1]/admin` or `/%XX/admin`

2. Existing Segment Prefix (Single Byte):
   - Prepends the byte to each existing segment individually
   - Example: `/admin/login` → `/[b1]admin/login` or `/%XXadmin/login`

3. Existing Segment Prefix (Two Bytes):
   - Prepends byte pairs to each existing segment
   - Example: `/admin/login` → `/[b1b2]admin/login` or `/%XX%YYadmin/login`

Each byte value is applied both as a raw byte (when safe) and in percent-encoded form to ensure maximum coverage of potential bypass vectors.

## http_methods 

The `http_methods` module tests various standard and non-standard HTTP methods loaded from a predefined list (`internal_http_methods.lst`). HTTP method switching is a well-known technique to bypass WAF rules that only filter specific methods.

For each method, it generates:

1. Base method variation:
   - Uses the specified method with the original URL's path and query string
   - Example: `OPTIONS /admin` instead of `GET /admin`

2. Content-Length handling:
   - For methods that typically expect a body (POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE), adds `Content-Length: 0` header
   - Example: `DELETE /admin` with `Content-Length: 0`

3. Query parameter relocation (POST only):
   - For POST requests with query parameters, creates a variant where:
     - Query string is removed from URL
     - Parameters are moved to the request body
     - Proper content type headers are set
   - Example: `POST /admin?id=1` becomes `POST /admin` with body `id=1`

## case_substitution 

The `case_substitution` module applies targeted case manipulations to bypass case-sensitive pattern matching in WAFs and ACLs.

It implements four distinct case manipulation strategies:

1. Terminal character case inversion:
   - Uppercases only the last letter of the path (if lowercase)
   - Example: `/admin` → `/admiN`

2. HTTP method case manipulation:
   - Uppercases the HTTP method (e.g., "GET", "POST")
   - Example: `get /admin` → `GET /admin`

3. Character-by-character case inversion:
   - Inverts the case of each letter in the path individually
   - Example: `/admin` → `/Admin`, `/aDmin`, `/adMin`, `/admIn`, etc.

4. Full path uppercase conversion:
   - Uppercases the entire path string
   - Example: `/admin` → `/ADMIN`

All original query parameters are preserved when applying these case manipulations.

## nginx_bypasses

The `nginx_bypasses` module targets Nginx-specific WAF bypass techniques and other proxy/server misconfigurations. It focuses on path manipulation and request splitting attacks.

It employs several advanced techniques:

1. Character insertion:
   - Inserts special bytes (raw and URL-encoded) at strategic positions:
     - At the end of the path: `/admin[char]`
     - After trailing slash: `/admin/[char]`
     - At the beginning: `/[char]admin`
     - After each path segment: `/segment1[char]/segment2`
     - Before each path segment: `/segment1/[char]segment2`
     - After the first character of each segment: `/s[char]egment1/s[char]egment2`

2. Request splitting with URL-encoded newlines:
   - Injects `%0A` followed by HTTP version strings
   - Example: `/admin%0AHTTP/1.1`

3. Complex routing manipulation:
   - Combines newlines, HTTP versions, and alternative URIs
   - Example: `/admin%0AHTTP/1.1%0Ahttp://localhost/admin`
   - Variations include localhost, 127.0.0.1, and custom port specifications

4. Host header manipulation:
   - Combines path manipulations with explicit Host headers
   - Targets misconfigured proxy pass-through and routing logic

The module is specifically designed to exploit parsing inconsistencies in Nginx configurations and other proxy servers where request normalization may differ between components.

## unicode_path_normalization 

The `unicode_path_normalization` module exploits inconsistencies in how different systems handle Unicode character normalization. It generates payloads using Unicode normalization forms to bypass signature-based WAFs.

The module applies multiple techniques:

1. Character replacement with Unicode equivalents:
   - Substitutes ASCII characters with their Unicode equivalents
   - Example: `/admin` → `/аdmin` (using Cyrillic 'а' instead of ASCII 'a')

2. Bidirectional text manipulation:
   - Uses right-to-left override characters to confuse path parsing
   - Example: `/admin` with inserted bidirectional control characters

3. Homoglyph substitution:
   - Replaces characters with visually similar Unicode characters
   - Example: `/admin` → `/аdmіn` (using Cyrillic 'і' instead of ASCII 'i')

4. Normalization form switching:
   - Applies different Unicode normalization forms (NFC, NFD, NFKC, NFKD)
   - Targets inconsistencies between WAF normalization and backend processing

These techniques are effective against systems where the WAF and application server normalize Unicode differently or where pattern matching fails to account for Unicode equivalence.

## Motivation

Traditional Go-based security tools often struggle with WAF bypasses because Go's standard libraries are designed to be secure by default, automatically normalizing URLs and encoding special characters. This makes it difficult to test certain types of bypasses that rely on specific URL structures or character sequences.

Go-Bypass-403 solves this by:
1. Using a custom URL parser that preserves raw paths
2. Implementing curl-like path preservation
3. Maintaining exact URL structures throughout the testing process
4. Allowing for true raw URL manipulation without automatic sanitization
5. The best similar tool that is publicly available was developed by [laluka](https://github.com/laluka) and can be found at the following URL: [bypass-url-parser](https://github.com/laluka/bypass-url-parser). It is written in Python, however, it uses curl for each bypass attempt, as curl supports `--path-as-is` to send raw payloads. Unfortunately, this tool is extremely slow because it uses curl to send the requests.
Quote from laluka:
> If you wonder why this code is nothing but a dirty curl wrapper, here's why:
>>    Most of the python requests do url/path/parameter encoding/decoding, and I hate this.
>>    If I submit raw chars, I want raw chars to be sent.
>>    If I send a weird path, I want it weird, not normalized.
>>
>This is surprisingly hard to achieve in python without losing all of the lib goodies like parsing, ssl/tls encapsulation and so on.
So, be like me, use curl as a backend, it's gonna be just fine.
