# GoByPASS403

A powerful WAF (HTTP 403/401) and URL parser bypass tool developed in Go, designed to preserve exact URL paths and structures during testing. Unlike Go's standard libraries, the tool enables true raw HTTP requests without any encoding or normalization, ensuring complete control over the request structure. This functionality is powered by a full-stack HTTP client, independent of Go's internals, and a custom URL parser.

## Features

- **Raw URL Preservation**: Unlike other Go tools that use the standard `net/url` package which automatically normalizes and encodes URLs, Go-Bypass-403 preserves the exact URL structure similar to curl's `--path-as-is` flag. This is crucial for WAF bypass attempts where path traversal and specific URL structures need to be maintained.

- **Custom URL Parser**: Implements a specialized URL parser that prevents Go's default security measures from interfering with bypass attempts. This allows for testing of edge cases and security boundaries that would otherwise be normalized away.

- **Multiple Bypass Techniques**: 
  - Path manipulation (mid-path, end-path)
  - Case substitution
  - Headers manipulation (IP, scheme, URL, port)
  - Character encoding variations
  - And more...

- **CDN Bypass Support**: Special features for testing CDN-based bypasses using host substitution

## Find CDN Bypasses Using A List Of Hosts 

Sometimes you want to find bypasses in a long list of CDNs, and you know that the video path is always the same. Example when you want to bypass the hash check on a video or image.

# Bypass Modules

Some description..

## char_encode

The `char_encode` module implements targeted character encoding techniques to bypass WAF pattern matching. It systematically generates payloads by applying URL encoding to specific characters in the path.

The module works on four strategic positions:

- Last character of the path
- First character after any leading slash
- Each character in the last path segment
- Each character throughout the entire path

For each position, it generates:
- Single encoding (`%xx`)
- Double encoding (`%25xx`)
- Triple encoding (`%2525xx`)

For example, with a URL like `https://example.com/admin`:

```
/admin → /admi%6e          # Last character encoded
/admin → /%61dmin          # First character encoded  
/admin → /adm%69n          # Character in path encoded
```

Special characters like `?` and `#` are handled with proper percent-encoding to preserve query parameters.

## mid_paths

The `mid_paths` module injects path traversal sequences and special character combinations using a predefined list of payloads (`internal_midpaths.lst`).

For a URL like `/a/b`, the module creates these variants:

1. Before path:
   - `PAYLOAD/a/b`
   - `/PAYLOAD/a/b`

2. At each segment:
   - `/PAYLOADa/b` (fused with first segment start)
   - `/aPAYLOAD/b` (fused with first segment end)
   - `/a/PAYLOADb` (fused with second segment start)
   - `/a/bPAYLOAD` (fused with second segment end)

3. After each slash:
   - `/a/PAYLOAD/b` (inserted after a slash)

Each variant is generated with appropriate path normalization handling. The module carefully manages special characters in path segments, generating additional variants with percent-encoded `?` and `#` characters when necessary.

## end_paths 

The `end_paths` module appends a variety of suffixes from a predefined list (`internal_endpaths.lst`) to the end of the URL path. This technique targets path normalization vulnerabilities and extension handling issues in WAFs.

For a URL like `https://example.com/admin`, the module generates:

1. Standard suffix variants:
   - `/admin/SUFFIX`
   - `/admin/SUFFIX/`

2. Direct append variants (when the base path isn't root `/` and suffix doesn't start with a letter):
   - `/adminSUFFIX`
   - `/adminSUFFIX/`

Common suffixes include:
- Path traversal sequences: `..;/`, `../`, `./`
- Special characters: `;`, `:`, `%20`
- Common extensions: `.json`, `.php~`, `.bak`

The module preserves the original query string and handles special characters with proper percent-encoding to maintain request integrity.

## Motivation

Traditional Go-based security tools often struggle with WAF bypasses because Go's standard libraries are designed to be secure by default, automatically normalizing URLs and encoding special characters. This makes it difficult to test certain types of bypasses that rely on specific URL structures or character sequences.

Go-Bypass-403 solves this by:
1. Using a custom URL parser that preserves raw paths
2. Implementing curl-like path preservation
3. Maintaining exact URL structures throughout the testing process
4. Allowing for true raw URL manipulation without automatic sanitization
5. The best similar tool that is publicly available was developed by [laluka](https://github.com/laluka) and can be found at the following URL: [bypass-url-parser](https://github.com/laluka/bypass-url-parser). It is written in Python, however, it uses curl for each bypass attempt, as curl supports `--path-as-is` to send raw payloads. Unfortunately, this tool is extremely slow because it uses curl to send the requests.
Quote from laluka:
> If you wonder why this code is nothing but a dirty curl wrapper, here's why:
>>    Most of the python requests do url/path/parameter encoding/decoding, and I hate this.
>>    If I submit raw chars, I want raw chars to be sent.
>>    If I send a weird path, I want it weird, not normalized.
>>
>This is surprisingly hard to achieve in python without losing all of the lib goodies like parsing, ssl/tls encapsulation and so on.
So, be like me, use curl as a backend, it's gonna be just fine.
