## CLI Options

3.1. Input Options
Target URL
-u, --url

The target URL for scanning (e.g., https://cms.facebook.com/login).

Target URL File
-l, --urls-file

Path to a file containing one target URL per line. Note: Cannot be used simultaneously with the single URL option.

Substitute Hosts File
-shf, --substitute-hosts-file

Specifies a file containing alternative hostnames. This option requires a single target URL (using -u) and cannot be combined with URL file input.

3.2. Bypass Modules & Scan Configuration
Bypass Module(s)
-m, --module

Comma-separated list of bypass modules. Supported modules:

```
dumb_check
mid_paths
end_paths
case_substitution
char_encode
http_headers_scheme
http_headers_ip
http_headers_port
http_headers_url
http_host
unicode_path_normalization
```

The keyword all expands to all available modules (except for dumb_check, which is prepended by default).

Threads 
Number of concurrent threads to use; defaults to 15.

```bash
-t, --threads
```


Timeout
-T, --timeout

Total request timeout in milliseconds (default is 20,000 ms).

Delay Between Requests
--delay

Delay (in milliseconds) between consecutive requests (default is 0, meaning no delay).

Maximum Retries & Retry Delay

Maximum retries for failed requests (default: 2) and the delay between retries (default: 500 ms).

Maximum Consecutive Failures
--max-cfr, --max-consecutive-fails

Defines after how many consecutive failed attempts a bypass module should cancel (default: 15).

Automatic Request Throttling
-at, --auto-throttle

Enables or disables auto-throttling of requests. Accepted values: on/off, 1/0, true/false (default: on).

3.3. Network & Proxy Options
Proxy
-x, --proxy

Proxy server URL, e.g., http://127.0.0.1:8080.

Spoof IP / Header
--spoof-ip and --spoof-header

Custom IP addresses and headers for IP spoofing experiments.

HTTP2 Support
--http2

Flag to enable HTTP2 functionality (currently a placeholder awaiting further implementation).

Follow HTTP Redirects
--fr, --follow-redirects

Determines whether to follow HTTP redirects (reserved for future enhancements).

3.4. Response & Output Options
Output Directory
-o, --outdir

Sets the directory for storing scan outputs and results. Defaults to a uniquely generated temporary directory.

Response Body Preview Size
--rbps, --response-body-preview-size

Maximum number of bytes to retrieve from the response body (default: 1024 bytes).

Disable Response Body Streaming
--drbs, --disable-response-body-streaming

Disables streaming response bodiesâ€”for use cases where only headers and small previews are required.

Disable Progress Bar
--dpb, --disable-progress-bar

Turns off the real-time progress bar when desired.

Verbose Output
-v, --verbose

Provides extended log information on the console.

3.5. Debug & Profiling
Debug Mode
-d, --debug

Activates debug mode, which includes detailed request tracking via a debug token system.

Resend Request
-r, --resend, --resend-request

Resends a previously generated request using its associated debug token for reproduction.

Resend Count: --rn, --resend-num (default is 1).

Profiling
--profile

Starts the integrated pprof profiler to capture and analyze performance metrics.

Update Payload Files
--update-payloads

Fetches and installs the latest bypass payload files from the official repository. On successful update, the application exits.

3.6. Content Filtering
Match Status Code
--mc, --match-status-code

Comma-separated list of HTTP status codes that should be considered valid. The keywords all or * match every status code.

Match Content Type
--mct, --match-content-type

Specifies one or more (comma-separated) valid substrings for good response content types (e.g., application/json,text/html).

1. Configuration Management & Validation
The CLI layer carries out rigorous validation:

Defaulting: If options are omitted, intelligent defaults are applied.

Mutual Exclusion: For example, the tool enforces that only one of -u (single URL) or -l (URLs file) is used at a time.

Data Processing: Complex inputs such as status code lists or flag values for auto-throttling are parsed and normalized for use downstream.

5. Execution Flow
Initialization:
The application logs its startup, loads payload directories, and instantiates the CLI runner.

Argument Parsing:
All provided options are parsed, validated, and processed. Inconsistent inputs (e.g., combining URL and URL file) result in an immediate error.

Profiling:
If enabled, the profiler is started early on to monitor performance.

Scanning:
Upon successful setup, the designated modules are executed concurrently based on the configuration.

6. Example Workflows
Single-Target Scan with Default Modules:

bash

Apply to Flow Archite...

Run

./go-bypass-403 -u "https://cms.example.com/login" -m all -t 20 -v

Multiple Target Scan Using a URL File:

bash

Apply to Flow Archite...

Run

./go-bypass-403 -l targets.txt -m "mid_paths,end_paths,case_substitution" -t 10 --delay 50

Resend Debug Request:

bash

Apply to Flow Archite...

Run

./go-bypass-403 -r "your_debug_token_here" --rn 3

This refactored CLI documentation presents the options in a structured, no-nonsense format tailored for a professional audience. It can now be integrated into your GitHub repository to assist users and fellow developers in understanding and leveraging the full capabilities of GoByPASS403.

# 4. Payload Generators (Bypass Vectors)

Sophisticated payload generation system implementing various WAF/403 bypass techniques:

## Path Manipulation
- **Mid-path Injection**:
  - Injects payloads at each path segment
  - Supports both pre-slash and post-slash variants
  - Intelligent path structure preservation
  - Multiple injection points per URL
- **End-path Manipulation**:
  - Appends payloads to URL endpoints
   - Four variant strategies per payload:
     - url/suffix
     - url/suffix/
     - urlsuffix (for non-letter payloads)
     - urlsuffix/
 - Context-aware path joining
## Header Manipulation
- **IP-based Headers**:
   - Supports custom IP spoofing via CLI
   - Special handling for Forwarded header (by/for/host variants)
   - Support for custom Header & IP spoofing
- **Protocol Scheme Exploitation**:
   - HTTPS/SSL forcing headers
   - Protocol scheme variation
   - Special handling for Front-End-Https
   - Forwarded proto manipulation
- **URL/Port Headers**:
  - Parent path traversal variants
  - Full URL and path-only variants
  - Port-specific bypass attempts
  - Context-aware header selection
- **Host Header Attacks**:
   - IP-based variants using cached DNS results
   - Three attack vectors:
      - IP URL + Original Host header
      - Original URL + IP Host header
      - IP URL + No Host header
      - IPv4/IPv6 bypasses
## Content Manipulation
- **Case Substitution**:
  - Character-by-character case inversion
  - Preserves URL structure
  - Efficient duplicate prevention
- **Character Encoding**:
  - multiple encoding levels:
      - Single URL encoding
      - Double URL encoding
      - Triple URL encoding
  - Selective character encoding
  - Path structure preservation
## Debug & Reproducibility
 **Debug Token System**:
 - Unique fingerprint per payload generated/request sent
 - Compressed binary format
 - Stateless request tracking
 - Structure:
   - Version identifier
   - Random nonce (8 bytes)
   - URL data (length-prefixed)
   - Header data (count + entries)
 - Memory-efficient (<256 bytes typical)
 - Full request reproduction capability using the debug token of each request.
  
## Common Features
- URL structure preservation
